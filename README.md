LP/NLP models for dairy ration planning: Create cow feed rations for periods and groups of cows as such that the total difference accross all periods and groups between cow/group requirements (energy, protein) and nutrients supplied is minimized.

All models use INRA's fill value system. Dry matter intake is therefore based on UEL, unite encombrement lait (LFU, lactating fill unit).
